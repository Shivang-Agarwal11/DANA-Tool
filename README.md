DANA is an AI-Powered CI/CD Management Platform that integrates agentic AI for intelligent automation, real-time observability, and low-code pipeline configuration.


## üåü Overview

In the field of DevOps Automation, CI/CD Optimization, and Agentic AI, DANA aims to enhance CI/CD pipeline observability, automate troubleshooting, and simplify pipeline creation using *low-code/no-code* solutions.

Many enterprises struggle with complex CI/CD configurations, pipeline failures, and inefficient monitoring, leading to deployment bottlenecks, higher costs, and developer frustration. DANA addresses these challenges by providing an integrated solution for managing and optimizing your DevOps pipeline.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Monitor and Visualize CI/CD Pipelines**: Dynamic, real-time insights on failures, build performance, and security compliance
- **Automate Failure Detection and Resolution**: Using AI agents trained on historical pipeline errors
- **Low-Code/No-Code Pipeline Creation**: Configure builds and deployments without writing complex scripts
- **Integration with Popular DevOps Tools**:
  - Jenkins for CI/CD pipeline monitoring
  - GitHub for repository management
  - SonarQube for code quality metrics

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

DANA consists of three main components:

1. **dana-main-server**: Backend Node.js server with MongoDB integration
2. **dana-ui**: Frontend UI application
3. **AgenticAI**: AI agents for Jenkins pipeline analysis and automation and for github automation for creating issues and analyzing PR's.

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for the backend and frontend)
- MongoDB
- Python with virtual environment support
- Ollama
- DeepSeek 1.5 r

### Setting up the Backend (dana-main-server)

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shivang-Agarwal11/DANA-Tool.git
   cd DANA-Tool/dana-main-server
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure environment variables:
   - Create a `.env` file with your MongoDB credentials

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Setting up the Frontend (dana-ui)

1. Navigate to the dana-ui directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../dana-ui
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the UI:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

### Setting up the AI Agent (AgenticAI-Jenkins)

1. Navigate to the AgenticAI directory:
   ```bash
   cd ../AgenticAI-Jenkins
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Install Ollama and DeepSeek 1.5 r

5. Run the agent:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
